## ðŸ§© Template

- You can use this template repository as reference to create a new repository with the same structure or clone the repository to start a new project. It will help you to organize your project structure and files. It works out of the box for most REST API service projects.
- You can customize (remove, modify or add) the files and directories as needed to meet your project requirements.
- If you want to use the template repository directly, just click the **[Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=rest.fastapi-template&template_owner=bybatkhuu)** button and follow the instructions.
- You can use **cookiecutter** to generate a new project from **[cookiecutter](https://github.com/bybatkhuu/rest.fastapi-template/tree/cookiecutter)** branch:

    ```sh
    # Clone the cookiecutter branch:
    git clone -b cookiecutter https://github.com/bybatkhuu/rest.fastapi-template.git

    # Install cookiecutter:
    pip install cookiecutter

    # Generate a new project from the cookiecutter template:
    cookiecutter -f ./rest.fastapi-template
    ```
