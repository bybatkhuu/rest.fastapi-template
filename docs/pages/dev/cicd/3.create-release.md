# ðŸ”– Create Release

## Overview

This GitHub Action automates the creation of a GitHub release after the **Build and Publish** workflow is completed. It can also be manually triggered.

## How It Works

The workflow is triggered via **manual dispatch** (`workflow_dispatch`). It was previously set to run automatically after the **Build and Publish** workflow but is now only triggered manually.

## Workflow Configuration

### **Trigger**

- **`workflow_dispatch`**: The workflow must be started manually via the GitHub Actions tab.

### **Environment Variables**

- **`_WORKFLOW_STATE`**: Tracks whether the **Update Changelog** workflow (`4.update-changelog.yml`) is active.

### **Jobs**

#### **1. Create Release**

This job generates a new GitHub release.

- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-22.04`
- **Permissions:**
    - `contents: write`
    - `actions: write`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Checkout the repository**
  2. **Create a GitHub release** using `gh release create` with auto-generated release notes.
  3. **Check if the Changelog workflow (`4.update-changelog.yml`) is active.**
  4. **Trigger the Changelog update workflow** if active.

## Usage

To trigger this workflow:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab.
3. Select **"3. Create Release"** from the workflow list.
4. Click **"Run workflow"** to start the release process.

## Required Secrets

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Required for creating the release and triggering workflows.

## Scripts Used

- **`get-version.sh`**: Retrieves the current version number for tagging the release.

## Notes

- The release is tagged as `v<version>` using `gh release create`.
- Release notes are automatically generated.
- If the **Update Changelog** workflow is active, it will be triggered.

## Troubleshooting

- If the workflow fails at the **Create Release** step, verify that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions.
- If the **Changelog update** is not triggered, ensure `4.update-changelog.yml` is configured correctly and its state is active.
- If the version is incorrect, check if `get-version.sh` is executable and returning the expected value.
