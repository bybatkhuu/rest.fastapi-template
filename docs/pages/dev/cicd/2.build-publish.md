# ðŸš€ Build and Publish

## Overview

This GitHub Action automates the process of building and publishing a Docker image. It runs after a version bump workflow is completed and also triggers on specific tag pushes.

## How It Works

The workflow is triggered in two cases:

1. When the **Bump Version** workflow (`1. Bump Version`) completes on the `main` branch.
2. When a push occurs to a tag matching the pattern `v*.*.*-*`.

## Workflow Configuration

### **Trigger**

- **`workflow_run`**: Runs after the **Bump Version** workflow completes.
- **`push` (tags matching `v*.*.*-*`)**: Runs when a version-tagged commit is pushed.

### **Environment Variables**

- **`_VERSION`**: Initially set to `3.0.0-250216`, but dynamically updated during the workflow execution.

### **Jobs**

#### **1. Build and Publish**

This job builds and pushes a Docker image.

- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-22.04`
- **Permissions:**
    - `contents: read`
    - `actions: write`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Checkout the repository**
  2. **Set up QEMU** (for multi-platform builds)
  3. **Set up Docker Buildx** (for efficient image building)
  4. **Login to Docker Hub** (using `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` from secrets)
  5. **Retrieve the version number** using `get-version.sh`
  6. *(Optional, commented out)* Build and export the image for local testing.
  7. *(Optional, commented out)* Run and test the Docker container.
  8. **Build and push the Docker image** with multi-platform support (`linux/amd64, linux/arm64`)
  9. **Trigger the release workflow** (`3.create-release.yml`)

## Usage

To trigger this workflow:

### **Automatic Execution**

- This workflow runs automatically **after the `1. Bump Version` workflow completes** on the `main` branch.
- It also runs automatically when a tag matching `v*.*.*-*` is pushed.

### **Manual Execution**

- Navigate to **Actions** in the repository.
- Select **"2. Build and Publish"** from the workflow list.
- Click **"Run workflow"** (if manual triggering is enabled).

## Required Secrets

- **`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`**: Docker Hub username.
- **`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`**: Docker Hub access token.
- **`DOCKER_UID_HASH_PASSWORD`**: Used as a build argument for the image.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: GitHub token for triggering the next workflow.

## Scripts Used

- **`get-version.sh`**: Extracts the current version number.
- **`bump-version.sh`**: (from previous workflow) Updates the version.

## Notes

- The **Build and Push** step builds an image and pushes it to Docker Hub with tags:
    - `latest`
    - The extracted version (e.g., `3.0.0-250216`)
- The `platforms` field is configured for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` architectures.
- Caching is enabled to speed up builds.
- The workflow **triggers the next step**, `3.create-release.yml`, using `gh workflow run`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the workflow fails during the **Docker Login** step, verify that `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` are correctly set.
- If the build fails, ensure `docker/setup-qemu-action` is using a stable version.
- If the version is not retrieved correctly, check if `get-version.sh` is executable.
- If the final release workflow is not triggered, confirm that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has the required permissions.
