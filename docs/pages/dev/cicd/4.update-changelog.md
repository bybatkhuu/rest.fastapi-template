# ðŸ’¥ Update Changelog

## Overview

This GitHub Action updates the changelog after a release has been created. It was initially designed to run automatically after the **Create Release** workflow but is now manually triggered.

## How It Works

The workflow is triggered manually using `workflow_dispatch`.

## Workflow Configuration

### **Trigger**

- **`workflow_dispatch`**: This workflow must be started manually via the GitHub Actions tab.

### **Jobs**

#### **1. Update Changelog**

This job updates the changelog file in the repository.

- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-22.04`
- **Permissions:**
    - `contents: write`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Checkout the repository** (with full history)
  2. **Update the changelog** using `changelog.sh`
  3. **Commit and push the updated changelog** using GitHub Actions bot

## Usage

To trigger this workflow:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab.
3. Select **"4. Update Changelog"** from the workflow list.
4. Click **"Run workflow"** to update the changelog.

## Required Secrets

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Used to commit and push changes to the repository.

## Scripts Used

- **`changelog.sh`**: Updates the changelog file with the latest release details.

## Notes

- The changelog is updated using `changelog.sh` with the `-c -p` flags.
- The changes are committed by the **GitHub Actions bot**.
- The workflow is no longer triggered automatically after the release process.

## Troubleshooting

- If the changelog does not update, check if `changelog.sh` is executable and correctly formatted.
- If there are permission errors, verify that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `contents: write` access.
- If the workflow does not run, ensure it is manually triggered from the **Actions** tab.
